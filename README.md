# 377 
A combination of [2584](https://github.com/TheReal23/2584) by TheReal23 and [256](https://github.com/aarextiaokhiao/Aarex2048) by Aarex Tiaokhiao, which are themselves descended from [2048](https://https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli.

## Notes on gameplay
Like 2584, this version uses the Fibonacci sequence instead of powers of 2. Like 256, the grid is reduced to 3x3, and only the lowest number (in this case 1) can spawn.
