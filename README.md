# 377 
This game is a combination of [2584](https://thereal23.github.io/2584) by TheReal23 and [256](https://aarextiaokhiao.github.io/Aarex2048/256) by Aarex Tiaokhiao. 2584 is based on [987](https://cozmic72.github.io/987) by cozmic72, which (along with 256) is based on [2048](https://play2048.co) by Gabriele Cirulli, which is based on [1024!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1024!/id823499224) by Veewo Studio and conceptually similar to [Threes!](http://play.threesgame.com) by Asher Vollmer. (Sheesh.) See also true65536's [huge list of 2048 variants](https://true65536.github.io/allthe2048).

## Notes on gameplay
Like 2584, this version uses the Fibonacci sequence instead of powers of 2. Like 256, the grid is reduced to 3x3, and only the lowest number (in this case 1) can spawn.
